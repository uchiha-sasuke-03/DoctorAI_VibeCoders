# 🩺 aidAR — AI-Powered First-Aid Assistant

## Three Steps to Immediate Help

### ① Describe Your Situation
Type or speak your symptoms in plain language. aidAR understands context, severity, and urgency from natural conversation.

### ② AI Analyzes & Responds
Our AI engine cross-references your symptoms against thousands of conditions and provides a structured, prioritized assessment.

### ③ Follow Visual Guidance
The 3D viewer and AR narrator walk you through procedures step-by-step with synchronized animations and voice narration.
